All of the priority's are set to normal and aren't assigned to anybody, we will need to go through the tickets 
and change these settings. Let's use the "online banking is down" ticket for example. 
</p>
<p>
<br />
  
<p>
Online Banking is down - "Business Impacting Issue", we need to change this to Emergency on Priority level & Assign to an Agent, ex. Jane Doe or yourself.

 SLA -Sev A due to it being at the top of priority list.

Department- Choose System Administrators. As you make changes to tickets there are a history of threads that
show updates and changes to track progress. Now we can reply at the bottom to communicate with the person who sent
out the ticket that you are contacting the system administrators and they are working on it. 

*Even if you have not resolved the ticket yet and it's taking longer than expected, it's still good
to check in and update the person who created the ticket that you are doing everything you can to fix
the problem.*

Now we can go back to main page and view the changes we made to priority level and assigned to. Once you have
reviewed the updated ticket, we can click back into it, write new message at the bottom that someone in Systems
Admin has located the problem and online banking should be up and running, make sure to click "Resolved" before Post Reply.

The Online Banking ticket should have disappeared from the other existing tickets and should be under "Closed tickets".

Now you can go in and edit the rest of the tickets by assigning them to a person, adjusting the priority levels, departments & SLA's until
finished with all remaining tickets.
